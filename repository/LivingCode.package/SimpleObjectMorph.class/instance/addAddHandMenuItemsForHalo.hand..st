addAddHandMenuItemsForHalo: aMenu hand: aHandMorph
	"The former charter of this method was to add halo menu items that pertained specifically to the hand.  Over time this charter has withered, and most morphs reimplement this method simply to add their morph-specific menu items.  So in the latest round, all other implementors in the standard image have been removed.  However, this is left here as a hook for the benefit of existing code in client uses."
